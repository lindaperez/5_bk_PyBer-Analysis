# Pyber Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 

Pyber is a Python based Ride-Sharing App company that required some help to improve ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. The best way to help them was developing an exploratory analysis on the data that they supplied. 

## Resources

The data extracted from several csv files: 

[city_data.csv](https://github.com/lindaperez/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Analysis.ipynb/Resources/city_data.csv)

[ride_data.csv](https://github.com/lindaperez/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Analysis.ipynb/Resources/ride_data.csv)

## Results 


### Percentage of total rides by city types: Rural, Suburban and Urban Areas

* 68.4% of the rides are in Urban areas 26.3% are in suburban areas and only 5.3% are in Rural areas.

### Percentage of total drivers by city types: Rural, Suburban and Urban Areas

* The total drivers in Urban areas represent the 80.9%, Suburban areas 16.5% and Rural areas only 2.6%

* Urban areas represent the highest source of income. 62.7% of the total fares come from Urban areas. 30.5% from Suburban areas and only 6.8% from Rural areas.


### Percentage of total fare amount by city types:  Rural, Suburban and Urban Areas

### Average number of fare per ride and Average number of fare per driver 

* For this measure the highers and lowers are different. There is a big difference between the average fare per ride from urban areas versus rural areas. 
Urban areas have the lowest fares and Rural areas have the highest fare respectively {Rural : 34.62, Suburban : 30.97, Urban : 24.53}


* Same reasoning with the measure of average fare per driver but in this case it is more balanced. Rural areas have the highest fares and Urban areas have the lowest fares respectively {Rural : 55.49, Suburban : 39.5, Urban : 16.57} per driver.

### Total of fares by city types (Suburba, Urban, Rural)

*  The Fares are stable across the months from January to April. Between Febrary and March an increment ocurred in all fares.

## Summary
Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

1. Analyze costs of life, expenses in vehicles, housing, travel distances can make reasonable impact in fares in Rural areas.
2. Analyze how the drivers are assigned to every zone. Is there any system or they are just hired. 
3. Analyze Job oportunities/acomodations/population are possible reasons for disparities in the number of drivers.
